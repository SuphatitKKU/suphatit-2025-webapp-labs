            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Suphatit Srichat, and I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student. I have a strong interest in web and app development. I enjoy creating digital experiences that are both user-friendly and visually appealing. Whether it's designing responsive websites or developing mobile apps, I find every step of the development process exciting.</p>
            <p>I chose to study Computer Engineering because it allows me to turn ideas into practical, working solutions. My dream is to become an app developer who can work from home, enjoy a flexible lifestyle, and have more time to spend with my family.</p>
            <p>Throughout my academic journey, I've developed a deep appreciation for problem-solving and innovation. I believe that technology should make life easier and more enjoyable for everyone.</p>

            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <p>Here are some of the key projects I've worked on during my studies:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li><b>Admission website</b></li>
                <p>A web-based admission system built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows students to submit applications, upload required documents, and check their application status. This project helped me understand the core principles of form handling, user experience design, and connecting front-end interfaces with back-end data.</p>
                <li><b>Travel web application</b></li>
                <p>A travel web application designed to help users plan their trips efficiently, featuring interactive mini-games where users can play to earn rewards. I developed this project for the Thailand New Gen Inventors Award competition and was honored to receive the Gold Medal. This experience enhanced my skills in user interface design, game integration, and creating engaging web experiences.</p>

                <h3>Building “Tripsback”: My First Big Web App Project</h3>
                <p>July 11, 2025</p>
                <p>Creating Tripsback, a travel web application, was one of the biggest challenges I’ve faced as a developer. I started building it back when I was in Grade 12, at a time when AI tools were not as common or advanced as they are today. That meant I had to search for tutorials, read documents, and learn everything by trial and error.</p>
                <p>I decided to use PHP for the backend, even though it's considered old by many people. The reason was simple  it had a huge amount of tutorials and support online, which helped me a lot as a beginner. For the database, I chose phpMyAdmin and wrote raw SQL queries to handle user data, trip plans, and rewards.</p>
                <p>Time was tight. It was my first time working on a serious project with a real deadline. I worked long hours, often skipping breaks. But during that time, I learned a lot about UI/UX design, creating prototypes, and how to make a website feel smooth and user-friendly.</p>
                <p>One of the things I’m most proud of is that I was able to turn Tripsback into a PWA (Progressive Web App)  which means it works like a native app on mobile devices. The app allows users to plan their trips, including <em>tourist spots, accommodations, transportation</em>, and even includes mini-games that let users earn points and redeem rewards.</p>
                <p>In the end, all the hard work paid off  Tripsback won the Gold Medal at the Thailand New Gen Inventors Award when I was in high school.</p>
